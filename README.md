## Description

"Lubomila's Portfolio" is a project, which aims to showcase my work and my continuous development. With this challenge, I would like to show my projects, information about me, increases my visibility and online presence, and build my professional identity. This weekly activity targets particular skills, which I developed by this point - accessibility, flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.

## Usage

The list shows what changes were made to improve the website:

- When the page is loaded the page presents my name, my logo, and links to sections about me, my projects and contact information.
- Clicking on one of the sections in the navigation bar, the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.

- I presented the main subject of the website with a banner image and a list of skills, which I have.
- Considering the aesthetic of my brand, I carefully chose the colour scheme.
- To apply the color palette easily, I used CSS Variables.
- In the "Projects" section I added three images, which are connected to the three fields of practice that I work on. To make the images representable I used the command in CSS - grid. So, the result is one bigger image and 2 smaller images on top of each other. 
- I added a subheading on all three images. Clicking on the subheading will lead the viewer to an external website:
   1. Clicking on "Graphic Design" will lead the viewer to my Behance profile. 
   2. Clicking on "Front End Web Developer" is leading to my GitHub account.
   3. Unfortunately, I have no work to show regarding "User Experience Design" that's why for now I connected the link to my GitHub account.

- The HTML links are displayed in a different color depending on whether it has been active or the mouse is over the link.

- The images in the "Projects" section were downloaded from the internet, just to give an idea of how the website should look like. 
- "Contact Me" section indcludes my location,phone number and email. 
- In order the website to be responsive I used media queries in CSS styles according to the device's type.
   1.  I used media query with max-width: 600px, in order to target small devices (phones, 600px and down).

   2. I used media query with max-width:768px , in order to target medium devices (landscape tablets ).
